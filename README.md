Files
sentiment_analysis.py - This is the main file that includes all the logic.
keys_format.py - This file is not meant to be used directly. Instead, copy this file in the same folder and rename it to keys.py. Then, put your Twitter API keys in keys.py. That way, my_twitter_bot.py will be able to use this information.
